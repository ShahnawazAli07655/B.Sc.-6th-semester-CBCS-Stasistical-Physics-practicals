## Experiment 2: Comparison of Statistical Distributions  
**File:** `Exp 2 all stats.sci`

### Aim  
To study and compare different statistical distributions used in statistical physics.

### Theory  
In statistical mechanics, particle distributions describe how particles occupy
available energy states. Classical systems follow Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics,
while quantum systems obey Fermi–Dirac or Bose–Einstein statistics.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand the difference between classical and quantum statistics.

## Experiment 3: Application of Statistical Physics  
**File:** `Exp 3.sci`

### Aim  
To numerically study an application of statistical physics.

### Theory  
Statistical physics provides a bridge between microscopic particle behavior
and macroscopic thermodynamic quantities using probabilistic methods.

### Learning Outcome  
Students learn to apply computational methods to statistical physics problems.

## Experiment 4: Debye Integral  
**File:** `Exp 4 DebyeIntegral.sci`

### Aim  
To numerically evaluate the Debye integral and study its physical significance.

### Theory  
The Debye model explains the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of solids.
The Debye integral plays an important role in calculating specific heat at
different temperatures.

### Learning Outcome  
Students understand lattice vibrations and low-temperature behavior of solids.

## Experiment 5: Maxwell–Boltzmann, Fermi–Dirac and Bose–Einstein Distributions  
**File:** `Exp 5 MB FD and BE distribution.sci`

### Aim  
To compute and compare MB, FD and BE distribution functions.

### Theory  
- Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics applies to classical particles.  
- Fermi–Dirac statistics applies to fermions obeying the Pauli exclusion principle.  
- Bose–Einstein statistics applies to bosons which can occupy the same quantum state.

### Learning Outcome  
Students visualize quantum effects and understand the classical limit of
quantum distributions.
